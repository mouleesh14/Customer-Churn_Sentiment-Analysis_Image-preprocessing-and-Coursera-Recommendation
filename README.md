# Customer-Churn_Sentiment-Analysis_Image-preprocessing-and-Coursera-Recommendation
The aim of this project is to predict the customer will convert as customer or not for the E-Commerce website dataset, Natural Languange Processing doing all the text preprocessing steps, Image preprocessing steps like gray_scale convertion, edge detection, etc.., preforming all the preprocessing techniques and Building Recommendation model for coursera dataset for selected courses by using colbrative filtering.

# Task to Do:
1. Customer Churn pridection for E-Commerce website
2. Natural Language Preprocessing (NLP)
3. Image Preprocessing
4. Recommendation Model for coursera dataset

# Customer Churn Prediction:
Dataset Informatiion: The dataset contains the information of user interacting with the website of request, response and interaction. column names like count session, count hit, avg_session_time, avg_session_time_page, num_interaction, transaction_revenue, time_on_site, etc.., related to the user and the webste. It contains the latitude and longtitude location of the user accessed the website.

# Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It encompasses a wide range of tasks aimed at enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. Text classification involves assigning predefined categories to documents, while machine translation translates text from one language to another automatically.

# Image Preprocessng:
Image preprocessing is a computer vision that involves applying various techniques to optimize raw images for subsequent analysis or machine learning tasks. These techniques aim to enhance image quality, reduce noise, and prepare the data for improved model performance. Converting color images to grayscale may be considered if color information is not critical for the task at hand, reducing computational complexity.
